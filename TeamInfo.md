## Project Summary

InsightEdge is a web application that helps eCommerce companies improve product quality & manage customer satisfaction by combining customer, purchase, and service data into one platform. Our application will have two main features:
  - Marketing Email Lists: Generate targeted customer lists for campaigns using preset or custom filters based on purchase history, returns, and satisfaction
  - Product Dashboard: Visualize sales, returns, and customer feedback to identify strong product categories & areas that need improvement
We plan to merge two Kaggle datasets (purchases + customer service interactions) to simulate a real eCommerce environment. The system will use relational databases for customers, purchases, employees, service calls, and products. The UI provides easy dropdown navigation for searching, managing employees, and running campaigns. As more data is added, marketing lists & dashboards will become more specific, and allow for personalized outreach. 

Future outlook: In the future, we may look to include Machine Learning powered alerts and email generation that intend to help companies proactively address satisfaction issues.
