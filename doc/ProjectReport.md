# Project Report

Edit: When doing the demo of our application on 11/20, the TA requested that we take our SQL commands from the Supabase SQL Editor and put them in a Google Colab document so you would have access to them. As mentioned previously, we used PostgreSQL instead of MySQL as that is what is compatible with Supabase. Here is the link to the notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19r-qOkPpCsN_3HKahWrfM_u0I0WPc4sU?usp=sharing


1. We had no major changes in our project plan since our project proposal. For our future outlook, we explored the possibility of Machine Learning in our application, but we were unable to integrate it in this phase of the project.
2. InsightEdge does a good job of consolidating multiple factors of eCommerce management into one platform. Instead of having to individually access information from various platforms, we combine it into one for accessibility. Users of said company can now loop up and manage employees in an efficient manner. Our marketing list and dashboard provides helpful insights because of merged customer and purchase data. The interactive role update also improves usability. Our limitations are that currently the marketing email automation is not implemented. Email lists are generated, but we have to send them out manually instead of automatically. 
3. The data source remained the same, as did the schema for the most part. The only change was the addition of a boolean attribute to the emaillist table to determine whether the list was built in or not.
4. There were no changes to our ER diagram and table implementations. We were satisfied with the approach we decided to use in the project proposal.
5. For functionality changes, we added a dynamic employee role update via a dropdown. Basically, a promotion/demotion button accessible to higher ranked staff who wish to promote/demote. We ended up removing the automated email list sending. We also didn’t do the ML-driven predictive alerts for customers.
6. Our advanced database programs complement InsightEdge by handling the complex multi-table joins and aggregations needed to generate accurate marketing lists and product performance directly from the backend. By computing customer segments, satisfaction trends, and return rates at the database level, the UI was able to simply display these insights without reprocessing the large amounts of data. 
7. Technical Challenges: 
    1. Mahir - Working in a large codebase with a lot of different technologies and features was difficult. It was helpful to map out the flow of data early on and comment additions to keep the project maintainable.
    1. Catie - I found that working with a new tech stack and new languages was difficult. Future teams should definitely set aside time to learn the tools before diving into full implementation.
    1. Emily - Learning how to use a new database management system and backend as a service was difficult. I’d recommend that future teams start with simple queries first, then gradually build more complex logic before it gets overwhelming.
    1. Satvika - My biggest challenge was getting more comfortable with backend development since I had less experience with it before this project. I had to learn how to handle database interactions. Future teams should test each layer separately while building so it’s easier to pinpoint where problems happen.
8. There really were not any changes between our final application and what we originally proposed. We stayed pretty close to our original plan.
9. In the future we hope to implement email sending automation based on the marketing list, that way it’s convenient and accessible for everyone to not worry about sending. Another goal is to add our idea of an ML driven alert for low customer satisfaction scores to improve customer engagement. We also hope to expand role management with more exclusive permissions and reporting. Right now all employees would have access to this, but for the future limit it to only HR, where you have to verify your position with a login or something to access permissions.  
10. We divided work up very well and everyone contributed equally. We were flexible in the collaboration and distribution of tasks based on every team member’s skills and past experiences.
